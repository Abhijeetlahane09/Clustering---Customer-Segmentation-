# Clustering---Customer-Segmentation-
Our clustering model on customer segmentation reveals three distinct segments: 'At-Risk/Lapsed,' 'Champions/Loyal,' and 'Potential Loyalists/Promising.' For 'At-Risk/Lapsed' customers, re-engagement strategies are recommended. 'Champions/Loyal' customers should receive exclusive deals and loyalty programs. 'Potential Loyalists/Promising' customers can be encouraged to visit more often with personalized communication and loyalty rewards. Our analysis also suggests implementing marketing strategies to retain high-value customers, effectively managing inventory, and considering international market expansion. Overall, our insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing marketing, sales, and inventory management efforts to drive growth and profitability."
